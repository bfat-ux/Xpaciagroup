            <h1>Q1 2026 Insight: Scaling Digital Health Beyond Pilots in Nigeria</h1>
            <p class="insight-meta">By Bernard Fatoye · Q1 2026 · 5 min read</p>
          </div>

          <p>
            In Nigeria's dynamic healthcare landscape, digital health initiatives hold immense
            potential to tackle entrenched issues like access inequities, data fragmentation, and
            resource limitations. Yet, many efforts remain confined to pilot stages, struggling to
            achieve broad adoption or lasting change. This insight explores how a systems-oriented
            approach, rooted in interoperability-first design, can propel these initiatives forward.
            Understanding how the health information pillar interconnects with other health system
            building blocks, such as service delivery, health workforce, essential medicines, and
            financing, is key. It is also crucial to recognize how health information technology
            systems are continually and critically becoming the backbone of health systems,
            particularly in digital health ecosystems.
          </p>

          <h2>The Pilot Trap in Nigerian Digital Health</h2>
          <p>
            Pilots abound, from telemedicine in urban centers to EHR implementations in rural
            facilities, demonstrating value in isolated settings, such as enhanced patient tracking
            or reduced administrative burdens. However, scaling often stalls due to overlooked
            interconnections: unreliable infrastructure, varying digital literacy, regulatory
            hurdles, and socioeconomic barriers. For example, a promising app in Lagos might fail
            in northern states if it does not account for intermittent connectivity or
            community-specific needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advanced health systems like those in the US or UK learned this the hard way, building
            silos that led to costly retrofits and persistent data islands. Nigeria, with less
            legacy baggage, can leapfrog by prioritizing interoperability from the start, ensuring
            data flows seamlessly across facilities, programs, and stakeholders to drive equitable,
            sustainable outcomes.
          </p>

          <h2>Commending Progress: NDHI and NPHCDA's Interoperability Efforts</h2>
          <p>
            The Nigeria Digital in Health Initiative (NDHI) deserves recognition for its
            forward-thinking work, particularly the National Enterprise Architecture for Digital
            Health (NDHA) draft. This blueprint envisions a unified, interoperable ecosystem with
            building blocks like the Health Information Exchange (HIE), Shared Health Record (SHR),
            and essential registries (for example, Client Registry based on NIN and Health Facility
            Registry). Guided by principles such as "One Patient - One Health Record" and federated
            models for state flexibility, NDHA emphasizes adaptability, security, and standards-based
            APIs to foster innovation while addressing local contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Complementing this is the NPHCDA Immunization FHIR Implementation Guide (IG), a strong
            example of interoperability in action. Built on FHIR R4, it standardizes immunization
            data, profiles for patients, immunizations, and adverse events, enabling seamless
            integration with registries, DHIS2, and CRVS. This IG not only supports routine
            vaccinations but also defaulter tracking and AEFI reporting, avoiding silos and paving
            the way for broader applications in maternal health or NCD management. By adopting
            global standards like FHIR with Nigerian-specific profiles, these efforts position the
            country to achieve semantic interoperability early, reducing errors and enhancing
            efficiency.
          </p>

          <h2>Key Strategies for Scaling with Interoperability First</h2>
          <p>
            To move beyond pilots, adopt an end-to-end framework that integrates technology with
            socioeconomic realities:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Holistic Assessment:</strong> Begin with a comprehensive systems map,
              evaluating IT infrastructure, data flows, and SDOH barriers. Use NDHA tools like
              terminology services (ICD-11, LOINC) to benchmark against national priorities, ensuring
              assessments account for offline support in low-connectivity areas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>SDOH-Informed Strategy:</strong> Craft roadmaps that embed interoperability
              standards (for example, FHIR profiles for consultations, prescriptions, immunizations).
              Incorporate stakeholder input to align tech with cultural norms, as seen in NDHI's
              user-centric principles, and prioritize affordable, open-source solutions for equity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Integrated Implementation:</strong> Leverage NDHA's HIE and registries for
              plug-and-play rollout. Partner with local innovators (for example, integrating with
              Helium Health) and include training for digital literacy gaps. Metrics should track
              SDOH impact, like improved rural access via telemedicine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ongoing Management &amp; Optimization:</strong> Utilize SHR and claims exchanges
              for real-time monitoring. Federated models allow state-level adaptations, while
              privacy-by-design (consent management, audit logs) guards against breaches. Retainers
              ensure iterative improvements, turning pilots into resilient systems.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Lessons from Nigerian Successes</h2>
          <p>
            Initiatives like Reliance Health's expansions or NHIS digital enrollments succeed by
            treating interoperability as foundational, linking IT backbones with policy and
            community engagement for 40%+ adoption gains. NDHA's emphasis on federation and
            standards avoids advanced systems' mistakes, enabling Nigeria to scale faster and more
            equitably.
          </p>

          <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
          <p>
            As Nigeria advances toward 2030 universal coverage, scaling digital health demands
            interoperability-first thinking. By commending and building on efforts like NDHA and the
            NPHCDA FHIR IG, we can leapfrog global pitfalls, creating systems that deliver inclusive,
            impactful care. If your organization is navigating pilots, HTA+ is here to guide
            end-to-end strategies.
